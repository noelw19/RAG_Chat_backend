The analogy of the ‘reservoir’ is from its\nvery nature an ambiguous one: a reservoir can be regarded either as a water\nstorage tank or as a source of water supply. There is no great difficulty in\napplying the image in both senses both to the ego and to the id, and it would\ncertainly have clarified the various passages that have been quoted—and in\nparticular the footnote on p. 30—if Freud had shown more precisely which\npicture was in his mind.\nThe second point is of greater importance.

In the New Introductory Lectures,\nonly a few pages after the passage referred to in the footnote above, in the\ncourse of a discussion of masochism, Freud writes: ‘If it is true of the\ndestructive instinct as well that the ego—but what we have in mind here is\nrather the id, the whole person—originally includes all the instinctual impulses\n...’ The parenthesis points, of course, to a primitive state of things in which the\nid and the ego are still undifferentiated. And there is a similar, but more\ndefinite, remark in the Outline, this time two paragraphs before the passage\nalready quoted: ‘We picture an initial state as one in which the total available\nenergy of Eros, which henceforward we shall speak of as “libido”, is present in\nthe still undifferentiated ego-id...’ If we take this as being the true essence of\nFreud's theory, the apparent contradiction in his expression of it is diminished.","metadata":{"source":"uploads/file-1742196517808-423068958.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Psychoanalytic Electronic Publishing: The Ego and the Id","Keywords":"","Creator":"Chrome","Producer":"macOS Version 10.14.6 (Build 18G87) Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20190825211301Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20190825211301Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":65},"loc":{"pageNumber":64,"lines":{"from":12,"to":24}}}}],["226",{"pageContent":"the still undifferentiated ego-id...’ If we take this as being the true essence of\nFreud's theory, the apparent contradiction in his expression of it is diminished.\nThis ‘ego-id’ was originally the ‘great reservoir of libido’ in the sense of being\na storage tank. After differentiation had occurred, the id would continue as a\nstorage tank but, when it began sending out cathexes (whether to objects or to the\nnow differentiated ego) it would in addition be a source of supply. But the same\nwould be true of the ego as well, for it would be a storage tank of narcissistic\nlibido as well as, on one view, a source of supply for object-cathexes.\nThis last point leads us, however, to a further question, on which it seems\ninevitable to suppose that Freud held different views at different times.
