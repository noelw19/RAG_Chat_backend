After\nreturning from a trip to India, where he observed the practice of adding meditation\nrooms to homes, he expanded the complex to include a private office. “In my retiring\nroom I am by myself,” Jung said of the space. “I keep the key with me all the time; no\none else is allowed in there except with my permission.”\nIn his book Daily Rituals, journalist Mason Currey sorted through various sources\non Jung to re-create the psychiatrist’s work habits at the Tower.

One of the explanations for this phenomenon turned out to be the formula\ndetailed earlier: The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity\nand  therefore  went  out  of  their  way  to  maximize  their  concentration—radically\nreducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the\nquality of their results.\nThe example of Adam Grant implies that this intensity formula applies beyond just\nundergraduate GPA and is also relevant to other cognitively demanding tasks. But why\nwould  this  be?  An  interesting  explanation  comes  from  Sophie  Leroy,  a  business\nprofessor at the University of Minnesota. In a 2009 paper, titled, intriguingly, “Why Is\nIt So Hard to Do My Work?,” Leroy introduced an effect she called attention residue.\nIn  the  introduction  to  this  paper,  she  noted  that  other  researchers  have  studied  the\neffect  of  multitasking—trying  to  accomplish  multiple  tasks  simultaneously—on","metadata":{"source":"uploads/file-1742367857554-880164140.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Deep Work","Author":"Cal Newport","Keywords":"Business & Economics / Time Management","Creator":"calibre (2.45.0) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","Producer":"calibre 1.31.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]","CreationDate":"D:20160114145155+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20160121235305+05'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"dc:title":"Deep Work","dc:description":"<p><b>An Amazon Best Book of January 2016 in Business & Leadership Pick</b><p><b><br></b><p><b>One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare.

In Part 1 of this book I criticized\nFacebook  for  the  design  of  its  new  headquarters.  In  particular,  I  noted  that  the\ncompany’s goal to create the world’s largest open office space—a giant room that\nwill reportedly hold twenty-eight hundred workers—represents an absurd attack on\nconcentration. Both intuition and a growing body of research underscore the reality\nthat sharing a workspace with a large number of coworkers is incredibly distracting—\ncreating  an  environment  that  thwarts  attempts  to  think  seriously.

To see Pritchard,\nusually  standing  a  foot  taller  than  most  of  his  suburbanite  customers,  wearing  the\nobligatory faded flannel of the farmer, is to see a craftsman confident in his trade. I\nintroduced  myself  to  him  because  farming  is  a  skill  dependent  on  the  careful\nmanagement of tools, and I wanted to understand how a craftsman in a nondigital field\napproaches this crucial task.","metadata":{"source":"uploads/file-1742367857554-880164140.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Deep Work","Author":"Cal Newport","Keywords":"Business & Economics / Time Management","Creator":"calibre (2.45.0) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","Producer":"calibre 1.31.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]","CreationDate":"D:20160114145155+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20160121235305+05'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"dc:title":"Deep Work","dc:description":"<p><b>An Amazon Best Book of January 2016 in Business & Leadership Pick</b><p><b><br></b><p><b>One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare.

Deep research for Lewis,\nI assume, requires him to spend weeks and months getting to know a small number of\nsources (he’s a master of the long-form journalism skill of drawing out a source’s\nstory  over  many  sessions),  and  careful  writing,  of  course,  requires  freedom  from\ndistraction. In both cases, Twitter at best has no real impact, and at worst could be\nsubstantially negative, depending on Lewis’s susceptibility to the service’s addictive\nattributes. The conclusion would therefore be that Lewis shouldn’t use Twitter.\nYou  might  argue  at  this  point  that  confining  our  example  to  this  single  goal  is\nartificial, as it ignores the areas where a service like Twitter has its best chance of\ncontributing.
